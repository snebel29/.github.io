This site was created with an initial idea in mind:

Share my projects, learn and help others doing so through [the Feynman's technique](https://forum.artofmemory.com/t/how-to-use-the-feynman-technique/32488)

Similar to a blog but open to revision and contributions, as you possible noticed English is not my main language so grammatic and typos foxes are welcome.

The whole site is hosted using github pages in my [github]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) and therefore, stars, issues and pull requests are welcome, all using simple [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) syntax.

The site is named upon military strategist, writter and phylosopher [Sun Tzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu) who is often credited for writting [The art of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War), you may often find quotes of the book.

> *"If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles" Sun Tzu.*
